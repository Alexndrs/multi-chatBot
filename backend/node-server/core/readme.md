```mermaid

graph TD
    A[ðŸ‘¤ User asks a **question 1** with two selected models]
    A --> B1[ðŸ¤– ChatGPT receives the question]
    A --> B2[ðŸ¤– Claude receives the question]

    B1 --> C1[ChatGPT generate **answer A** and stream it]

    C2 --> D

    D --> E[**merge** by chatGPT - as merger+reviewer - is streamed]
    E --> F[user asks **question 2**]
